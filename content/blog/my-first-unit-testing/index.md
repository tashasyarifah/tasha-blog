Yesterday, I learned how to do testing. At first, I thought unit testing and A/B testing is similar. Itâ€™s not. Unit testing is testing your code to make sure that your code is working for specific functions. Let's say you want to test for the sum function. Then, you can test the sum function only. On the other hand, A/B testing is testing your product between versions A and B. Let's say what happened if you put your call-to-action button on the left instead of the center? Which one shows the best performance? This is a kind of A/B testing.  

After knowing the difference, I realized what I want to learn for now is unit testing. I learn how to do unit testing using Jest. Jest is a JavaScript testing framework.
You can do testing almost for every framework. [You can read in their doc](https://jestjs.io/). However, right now I'm gonna go with the basics (without any framework).

## Preparations 

I'm using VS Code as my IDE. Already have npm installed. A clear mind for absorbing new information. [FYI: I'm feeling a bit afraid of knowing nothing. To convince me that it's okay to not understand on the first try].

## The Process

I read their doc and follow their [getting started section](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started). Everything was smooth. Thus, I try to read the code. There are terms the unfamiliar to me.
